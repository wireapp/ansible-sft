# NOTE: variables set here can - and potentially should - be overridden when invoking the role


# INFO: The following variables are MANDATORY and will be tested for existence

# There are three different ways to define which version is going to be installed.
# All of them are mutual exclusive.
# 1.
# sft_artifact_file_path: local path in filesystem
#
# 2. (requires the checksum URL to follow certain pattern
# sft_version: string of a specific release version)
#
# 3.
# sft_artifact_file_url: URL
# sft_artifact_checksum: URL or values

# sft_fqdn: String

# sft_metrics_ca_url: URL

# NOTE: either certbot is enabled or TLS files key and cert are provided
#
# certbot_account_email: String
# tls_key_path: String
# tls_cert_path: String

# FUTUREWORK: consistency: rename sft_ variables to sftd_ (currently some things
# are named sft and others sftd which is confusing).
#
# FUTUREWORK: adhere to naming best practices: rename all variables to have a
# prefix (like sft_ or sftd_) in order not to clash with other roles which may
# also have a `metrics_enabled`.

service_name: "{{ role_name }}"

# NOTE: filters out private networks as of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918#section-3
#       override to mitigate this behaviour entirely
# NOTE: there is no excluding filter, just including ones, hence such cumbersome syntax

# NOTE: exclude certain versions from being supported by the SFT server.
