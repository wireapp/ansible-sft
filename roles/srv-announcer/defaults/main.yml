# NOTE: variables set here can - and potentially should - be overridden when invoking the role


# INFO: The following variables are MANDATORY or will be tested for existence

# There are three different ways to define which version is going to be installed.
# All of them are mutual exclusive.
# 1.
# announce_artifact_file_path: local path in filesystem
#
# 2.
# announcer_version: string of a specific release version
#
# 3.
# announce_artifact_file_url: URL
# announce_artifact_checksum: value

# DOCS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html
# announcer_aws_key_id: String
# announcer_aws_access_key: String
# announcer_aws_region: String

# announcer_zone_domain: String, e.g. domain.tld

# NOTE: The srv-announcer can only manage one entry in the SRV record list, but the role allows
#       to define multiple entries. For each entry a new systemd unit is created. To also
#       facilitate the usecase of removing a certain unit file, each block allows to define the
#       attribute `deprecated` in order to indicate a unit removal. After running a play with
#       that attribute, the whole block can be safely removed
# EXAMPLE:
# ```yaml
#  mx:
#    name: _mx._tcp.sub.
#    target: mx1.sub.domain.tld
#  metrics:
#    name: _metrics._tcp.sub.
#    target: monitoring.sub.domain.tld
#    deprecated: true
# ```
announcer_srv_records: {}


# INFO: The following variables are NOT mandatory and won't be tested for existence

# NOTE: in seconds
announcer_record_ttl: 60
# NOTE: relative values
announcer_record_priority: 10
announcer_record_weight: 10

announcer_record_port: 443
